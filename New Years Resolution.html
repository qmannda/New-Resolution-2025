      <img src="" alt="" />
      <p>
        As a young person with big dreams there are a couple of things I need to
        set right before I can welcome the blessings that are to enter my life.
        The first order of business:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>I want to change my physical and mental health</strong></li>
        <li class="indent">
          For my physical health:
          <div>
            I want to work on my body, internally and externally. I want to eat
            healthy and balanced meals but they don't need to be boring like
            rice, chicken and beans. I want to prioritize my gut health. I want
            to go back to attending the gym, I want to go to pilate classes once
            a week. I want to stay disciplined in my attendance at the gym and
            any and all classes I sign up for.
            <img src="" alt="fun rice and chicken alternative" />
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="indent">
          For my mental health:
          <div>
            I want to work on expressing my emotions and not bottling things up.
            I've realised in the recent months that I tend to tuck things away
            in my mind and just try my best to forget about them. I've noticed
            that even though I hide them in deep and far away places in my mind
            they still seem to affect in some way or form. This year I want to
            start journeling what's happening in and around me, maybe even start
            going to therapy as well.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >I am officially done with school, I am graduating in May 2025. I
            want to create a legacy or career I am proud of</strong
          >
        </li>
        <li class="indent">
          I want to work in Tech, despite my BSc in Human Physiology
          <div>
            My journey in tech actually started in 2021, in one of my first year
            modules at the time. The module was called WTW 155 Mathematical
            Modelling. In this class we were taught about Python, now at the
            time I did not realise that it would change my life for the better
            but here I am today with 4 certifications from SheCodes and many
            beautiful projects. Tech is a booming industry that has many
            opportunities, some may require experience and some may not. Either
            way this is the year I find my spot in tech. I want this job to be
            my early birthday gift to myself.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >I want to see the world, but first I'll start with travelling in my
            own country</strong
          >
        </li>
        <li class="indent">
          The world is my oyster
          <div>
            At the end of this year I want to take myself to a different city in
            my country and see and try new things as a well done for surviving
            the first year of being an adult. I want to travel locally this
            december then 2 years after that I want to travel internationally,
            until I find a place that I would like to relocate to.
