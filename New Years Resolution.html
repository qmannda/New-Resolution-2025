      <p>
        As a young person with big dreams there are a couple of things I need to
        set right before I can welcome the blessings that are to enter my life.
        The first order of business:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>This year I will strengthen my relationship with God</strong>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li class="indent">
            <div>
              This year I will continue the journey I started last year to
              strengthen my relationship with God. I may not have attened study
              school but I know God will lead me and guide through this journey.
              This is the year I make friends that always have the same values
              as me, as I have done in the past.
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>I want to change my physical and mental health</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li class="indent">
            For my physical health:
            <div>
              I want to work on my body, internally and externally. I want to
              eat healthy and balanced meals but they don't need to be boring
              like rice, chicken and beans. I want to prioritize my gut health.
              I want to go back to attending the gym, I want to go to pilate
              classes once a week. I want to stay disciplined in my attendance
              at the gym and any and all classes I sign up for.
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li class="indent">
            For my mental health:
            <div>
              I want to work on expressing my emotions and not bottling things
              up. I've realised in the recent months that I tend to tuck things
              away in my mind and just try my best to forget about them. I've
              noticed that even though I hide them in deep and far away places
              in my mind they still seem to affect in some way or form. This
              year I want to start journaling what's happening in and around me,
              maybe even start going to therapy as well.
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <li>
          <strong
            >I am officially done with school, I am graduating in May 2025. I
            want to create a legacy or career I am proud of</strong
          >
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li class="indent">
            I want to work in Tech, despite my BSc in Human Physiology
            <div>
              My journey in tech actually started in 2021, in one of my first
              year modules at the time. The module was called WTW 155
              Mathematical Modelling. In this class we were taught about Python,
              now at the time I did not realise that it would change my life for
              the better but here I am today with 4 certifications from SheCodes
              and many beautiful projects. Tech is a booming industry that has
              many opportunities, some may require experience and some may not.
              Either way this is the year I find my spot in tech. I want this
              job to be my early birthday gift to myself.
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <li>
          <strong
            >I want to see the world, but first I'll start with travelling in my
            own country</strong
          >
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li class="indent">
            The world is my oyster
            <div>
              At the end of this year I want to take myself to a different city
              in my country and see and try new things as a well done for
              surviving the first year of being an adult. I want to travel
              locally this december then 2 years after that I want to travel
              internationally, until I find a place that I would like to
              relocate to.
            </div>
          </li>

        <li>
          <strong>This year will be the year my relationship flourishes</strong>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li class="indent">
            I want a happy and healthy relationship with my man
            <div>
              I will have a relationship with Daniel that is healthy, kind,
              gentle, and full of growth, both in the relationship and as
              individuals. We will continue to build on the foundation we have
              already. This is the year we travel together as a couple. We will
              see the world together. Wherever he goes, I go and wherever I go
              he goes. In our relationship we will put God first, because He
              brought us together for a reason. The reason being: we will get
              married and have 3/4 kids together. I love this man so much ‚ù§Ô∏è
